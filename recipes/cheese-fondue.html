    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Fondue is melted cheese served in a pot over a portable stove. People dip bread into the communal pot using long-stemmed forks. The Swiss dish gained popularity in the U.S. in the 1960s and remains popular today.</p>
    <p>This fondue recipe calls for Gruyère and Swiss cheeses because they're creamy, buttery, and melt smoothly. Other good choices include Gouda, fontina, and Emmental.</p>
